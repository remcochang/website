  abstract = {Large financial institutions such as Bank of America handle hundreds
    of thousands of wire transactions per day. Although most transactions
    are legitimate, these institutions have legal and financial obligations
    to discover those that are suspicious. With the methods of fraudulent
    activities ever changing, searching on predefined patterns is often
    insufficient in detecting previously undiscovered methods. In this
    paper, we present a set of coordinated visualizations based on identifying
    specific keywords within the wire transactions. The different views
    used in our system depict relationships among keywords and accounts
    over time. Furthermore, we introduce a search-by-example technique,
    which extracts accounts that show similar transaction patterns. Our
    system can be connected to a database to handle millions of transactions
    and still preserve high interactivity. In collaboration with the
    Anti-Money Laundering division at Bank of America, we demonstrate
    that using our tool, investigators are able to detect accounts and
    transactions that exhibit suspicious behaviors.Information Visualization
